## Installation

1. Install [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) and
   [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) if you don't already
   have them. For example:

   - **Homebrew**

     ```sh
     brew install gh fzf
     ```

   - **DNF**

     ```sh
     sudo dnf install gh fzf
     ```

   - ... see the links above for other package managers

2. Authenticate with the GitHub CLI:

   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Install this extension:

   ```sh
   gh extension install benelan/gh-fzf
   ```

## Usage

```sh
gh fzf <command> [flags]
```

This extension adds a new command that wraps GitHub's `list` subcommands with
fzf to make them fuzzy findable. All of the arguments after `<command>` are
passed directly to `gh`. Because of the way shell works, you need to escape
quotes required by GitHub, e.g. [strings with whitespace](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#use-quotation-marks-for-queries-with-whitespace).
There are example usages for each command in the sections below.

A preview of the current selection is displayed when navigating through the
resulting list. Each command has keybindings to further filter the list or to
call other `gh` subcommands on the item. There are also a few global keybindings
that can be used with any `gh fzf` command:

- `ctrl-o`: Open the selected item in the browser
- `ctrl-y`: Copy the selected item's URL to the clipboard
- `ctrl-r`: Reload the list to its initial filter state and fetch changes from
  GitHub
- `alt-1` to `alt-9`: Change the number of items fetched from GitHub to 100,
  200, ..., 900
- `alt-P`: Toggle the preview window
- `alt-H`: Toggle the header display, where the keybinding hints are located

### `issue`

- **Usage**: `gh fzf issue [flags]`
- **Aliases**: `i`, `issues`, `-i`, `--issue`, `--issues`
- **Flags**: See `gh issue list --help` for available options
- **Keybindings**:
  - `enter`: Edit the selected issue in the CLI via prompts
    (see `gh issue edit --help`)
  - `alt-o`: Checkout the issue's linked branch, creating one if necessary
    (see `gh issue develop --help`)
  - `alt-c`: Add a comment to the selected issue
    (see `gh issue comment --help`)
  - `alt-X`: Close the issue
    (see `gh issue close --help`)

    ```
  - Filter the initial list to issues with the "good first issue" label, no
    assignee, and in the "backburner" milestone. Uses [GitHub's search syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests):
    ```sh
    gh fzf i -S \'no:assignee label:\"good first issue\" milestone:backburner\'

  - `alt-a`: Filter the list, showing pull requests assigned to you
  - `alt-A`: Filter the list, showing pull requests authored by you
  - `alt-b`: Filter the list, showing pull requests from the current branch
  - `alt-s`: Filter the list, showing pull requests with any state
    (open, closed, or merged)
- **Examples:**
  - Filter the initial list to your merged pull requests with the
    "breaking change" label:
    ```sh

## Configuration

Environment variables are used to configure different options in `gh-fzf`.

| Variable                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Default                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GH_FZF_DEFAULT_LIMIT`   | The initial number of items to request from GitHub. The number of items can be changed at runtime with the `alt-1` to `alt-9` commands, see the [Usage](#usage) section for more info.                                        | 69                                                                                                           |
| `GH_FZF_TRUNCATE_FIELDS` | Set the variable to any value to make `gh` truncate text to ensure all fields fit on the screen. When set, truncated text is **not** fuzzy findable. When unset, fields may be cut off, but all text is still fuzzy findable. | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_HIDE_HINTS`      | Set the variable to any value to hide the header (where the keybinding hints are) on startup. The header can still be toggled with the `alt-H` keybinding.                                                                    | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_COPY_CMD`        | The command used by your operating system to copy an item's URL to the clipboard. Expects the URL from stdin. This only needs to be set if the default doesn't work on your machine.                                          | [see code](https://github.com/benelan/gh-fzf/blob/830e6562f9494a5489d5c4c38c99ed409908cf32/gh-fzf#L124-L134) |

You can set the [`FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables)
environment variable to add/change `fzf` options used by `gh-fzf` commands.

For example, create aliases in the `gh` config file that add new keybindings to
the issue and pr commands:

```yml
# ~/.config/gh/config.yml
aliases:
  i: |
    !FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
      --bind='alt-+:execute(gh issue edit --add-assignee @me {1})'
      --bind='alt--:execute(gh issue edit --remove-assignee @me {1})'
    " gh fzf issue $*
  p: |
    !FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
      --bind='alt-+:execute(gh pr review --approve --body \":+1:\" {1})'
      --bind='alt--:execute(gh pr review --request-changes {1})'
      --bind='alt-m:execute(gh pr merge --delete-branch --squash {1})'
      " gh fzf pr $*
```

When adding or modifying fzf keybindings:

- use `{1}` in place of the `<number>` for the `issue` and `pr` commands.
- use `{-1}` in place of the `<run-id>` for the `run` command.

For a list of the fzf options shared by all `gh-fzf` commands, see the
[source code](https://github.com/benelan/gh-fzf/blob/c455e3034f49da1ae81c26779de2419fda87e4a8/gh-fzf#L145-L165).

**NOTE:** If any of the keybindings set by `gh-fzf` don't work, you may be
overriding them in your shell's start up scripts (e.g. `~/.bashrc`) by setting
the `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` environment variable.

## Related projects

- [`gh-f`](https://github.com/gennaro-tedesco/gh-f): another `fzf` wrapper
  around `gh` that also provides some `git` functionality.

**NOTE:** `gh-fzf` leaves `git` functionality to other tools, and instead
focuses on providing keybindings to run `gh` subcommands on the selected item.
The following `fzf` wrappers around `git` are both good options to bridge that
gap:

- [`forgit`](https://github.com/wfxr/forgit)
- [`git-fuzzy`](https://github.com/bigH/git-fuzzy)
