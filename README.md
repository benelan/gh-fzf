## Installation

1. Install [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) and
   [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) if you don't already
   have them. For example:

   - **Homebrew**

     ```sh
     brew install gh fzf
     ```

   - **DNF**

     ```sh
     sudo dnf install gh fzf
     ```

   - ... see the links above for other package managers

2. Authenticate with the GitHub CLI:

   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Install this extension:

   ```sh
   gh extension install benelan/gh-fzf
   ```

4. **[???](#usage)**
5. **PROFIT**

### Upgrading

To upgrade `gh-fzf` to the latest commit on `main` **(recommended)**:

```sh
gh extension upgrade gh-fzf
```

Alternatively, you can pin a tag when installing `gh` extensions. If you already
have `gh-fzf` installed, you need to remove it first before pinning a version:

```sh
gh extension remove fzf && gh extension install benelan/gh-fzf --pin "v0.8.0"
```

There is also a `stable` tag, which always points to the latest release.

The [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) contains a list of features and fixes released
in each version. You can also view the release notes on the command line with:

```sh
gh fzf changelog
```

To see the version of `gh-fzf` you currently have installed:

```sh
gh fzf -v
```

## Usage

```sh
gh fzf <command> [flags]
```

This extension adds a new command that wraps GitHub's `list` subcommands with
fzf to make them fuzzy findable. All of the arguments after `<command>` are
passed directly to `gh`. Because of the way shell works, you need to escape
quotes required by GitHub, e.g. [strings with whitespace](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#use-quotation-marks-for-queries-with-whitespace).
There are usage examples for each command in the sections below.

A preview of the current selection is displayed when navigating through the
resulting list. Each command has keybindings to further filter the list or to
call other `gh` subcommands on the item. There are also a few global keybindings
that can be used with any `gh fzf` command:

- `ctrl-o`: Open the selected item in the browser
- `ctrl-y`: Copy the selected item's URL to the clipboard
- `ctrl-r`: Reload the list to its initial filter state and fetch changes from
  GitHub
- `alt-1` to `alt-9`: Change the number of items fetched from GitHub to 100,
  200, ..., 900
- `alt-P`: Toggle the preview window display
- `alt-H`: Toggle the header display, where the keybinding hints are located

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GH_FZF_DEFAULT_LIMIT`           | The initial number of items to request from GitHub. The number of items can be changed at runtime with the `alt-1` to `alt-9` commands, see the [Usage](#usage) section for more info.                                                                                                                         | 69                                                                                                           |
| `GH_FZF_TRUNCATE_FIELDS`         | Set the variable to any value to make `gh` truncate text to ensure all fields fit on the screen. When set, truncated text is **not** fuzzy findable. When unset, fields may be cut off, but all text is still fuzzy findable.                                                                                  | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_HIDE_HINTS`              | Set the variable to any value to hide the header (where the keybinding hints are) on startup. The header can still be toggled with the `alt-H` keybinding.                                                                                                                                                     | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_BRANCH_PREFIX`           | A string to prepend to the branch name entered for the `pr` command's `alt-o` keybinding. Spaces are replaced with hyphens. See the [commit](https://github.com/benelan/gh-fzf/commit/f6f78e2dce617f17c6048f28f568fbdc57895119) message for examples.                                                          | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_BRANCH_ADD_ISSUE_NUMBER` | When set, the issue number is added after the prefix (if specified) for the `pr` command's `alt-o` keybinding. The variable's value is added after the number, unless it is a space. See the [commit](https://github.com/benelan/gh-fzf/commit/f6f78e2dce617f17c6048f28f568fbdc57895119) message for examples. | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_NOTIFY_ICON`             | A path to an icon for the desktop notification displayed by the `run` command's `alt-n` keybinding. Only supported by `dunstify` and `notify-send` for now.                                                                                                                                                    | unset                                                                                                        |
| `GH_FZF_COPY_CMD`                | The command used by your operating system to copy an item's URL to the clipboard. Expects the URL from stdin. This only needs to be set if the default doesn't work on your machine.                                                                                                                           | [see code](https://github.com/benelan/gh-fzf/blob/830e6562f9494a5489d5c4c38c99ed409908cf32/gh-fzf#L124-L134) |

You can also set the [`FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables)
environment variable to add/change `fzf` options used by `gh-fzf` commands.

For example, create aliases in the `gh` config file that add new keybindings to
the [`issue`](#issue), [`pr`](#pr), [`run`](#run), and [`milestone`](#milestone)
commands:

```yml
# ~/.config/gh/config.yml
aliases:
  i: |
    !FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
      --bind='alt-+:execute(gh issue edit --add-assignee @me {1})'
      --bind='alt--:execute(gh issue edit --remove-assignee @me {1})'
      --bind='alt-@:execute(
        selected=\"\$(gh fzf milestone)\"
        [ -n \"\$selected\" ] && gh issue edit --milestone \"\$selected\" {1}
      )'
    " gh fzf issue $*

  p: |
    !FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
      --bind='alt-+:execute(gh pr review --approve --body \":+1:\" {1})'
      --bind='alt--:execute(gh pr review --request-changes {1})'
      --bind='alt-m:execute(gh pr merge --delete-branch --squash {1})'
      " gh fzf pr $*

  r: |
    !FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
      --bind='alt-e:execute(gh run view --log-failed {-1})'
      --bind='alt-q:reload(eval \"\$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND --status queued\")'
    " gh fzf run $*

  m: |
    !FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS
      --bind='alt-bspace:execute(
        gh api --silent --method DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/{-1}
      )+reload(eval \"\$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND\")'
    " gh fzf milestone
```

When adding or modifying fzf keybindings:

- Use `{1}` in place of:
  - the `<number>` for the [`issue`](#issue) and [`pr`](#pr) commands
  - the `<tag>` for the [`release`](#release) command
  - the `<id>` for the [`gist`](#gist) command
  - the `<name>` for the [`label`](#label) command
- Use `{-1}` in place of:
  - the `<run-id>` for the [`run`](#run) command
  - the `<workflow-id>` for the [`workflow`](#workflow) command
  - the `<number>` for the [`milestone`](#milestone) command

For a list of the fzf options shared by all `gh-fzf` commands, see the
[source code](https://github.com/benelan/gh-fzf/blob/f8d5b23e283e234557cbed615993e618fd45ccf3/gh-fzf#L109-L129).

> [!WARNING]
> If any of the shared keybindings set by `gh-fzf` don't work, you may be
> overriding them in your shell's start up scripts (e.g. `~/.bashrc`) by setting
> the `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` environment variable.

## Related projects

There is another `fzf` wrapper around `gh` that also provides some `git`
functionality. However, it doesn't provide as many `gh` commands, keybindings,
or configuration options.

- [`gh-f`](https://github.com/gennaro-tedesco/gh-f)

The main focus of `gh-fzf` is providing keybindings to run `gh` subcommands on
the selected item, so `git` functionality is left to other tools. The
following `fzf` wrappers around `git` are good options to bridge that gap.

- [`forgit`](https://github.com/wfxr/forgit)
- [`git-fuzzy`](https://github.com/bigH/git-fuzzy)
